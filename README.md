🔁 Class 10 Programs: Intermediate logic building, method creation, nested loops, arrays, and basic string manipulation.

🧠 Class 11 Programs: Object-oriented programming (OOP), advanced arrays, recursion, file handling, and utility-based projects.

🧰 Tools & Language:
IDE: Visual Studio Code

Language: Java

Extensions Used: Extension Pack for Java, Code Runner, Python, Windsurf, BlackboxAI, Tabnine, GitLens, Live Server, Java by Red Hat, etc.

🎯 Purpose:
This repo serves as a portfolio of my Java learning journey. Whether you're a student, a beginner in Java, or someone reviewing Java basics, feel free to explore and learn from these structured code examples.
